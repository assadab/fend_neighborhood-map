## Neighbordhood Map Project

This project is part of Udacity's Front End Development nanodegree program.

## Why this Project?

You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).(Credit to:Udacity)

## Project Implementation

- An interactive map made using the Google Maps API.
- Added search functionality for the locations and an AJAX call for the places information.
- Used Knockout.js, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS
